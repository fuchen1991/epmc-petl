# Plugin usage information

## Plugin list specification

This plugin contains the JUnit tests used to check the correctness of the results computed by ePMC.
In order to perform the tests, the different plugins have to be included. 
This is obtained by creating an appropriate file inside the directory `src/test/resources/` whose name should follow the format
```
hostname[.domainname]_username.pluginlist
```
See the already present files for reference.


## Tests involving PRISM models

The JUnit tests involving PRISM models make use of the `System.getProperty("user.home")` java property to locate the PRISM files. 
This property resolves for instance to `/User/<username>` in MacOS and `/home/<username>` in Linux.

The PRISM models are expected to be located inside the directory `System.getProperty("user.home")/prism-examples/` with the same structure as the directory `examples` contained in the PRISM tool archive. 
The easiest way to have the files available for the JUnit tests is to create a symbolic link by means of the command
```
ln -s <path to PRISM>/examples ~/prism-examples
```


## Tests involving JANI models

The JUnit tests involving JANI models make use of the `System.getProperty("user.home")` java property to locate the JANI files, which are expected to be located inside the directory `System.getProperty("user.home")/exported-jani-models/`. 
The files corresponding to the PRISM models can be generated by running the `convertPRISMIncluded()` JUnit test from `ExportPRISMToJaniModels.java`.
