Note by Ernst Moritz Hahn: This version of CacBDD is based on
http://www.kailesu.net/CacBDD/CacBDD.zip

However, it was modified according to the following mail (14/07/2015):

Dear Ernst,

About CacBDD sources
 the condition "if(toph = v)" shoud be changed as "if(toph == v)". 
Also in the same function 
DD  XManager::IteRecur(DD f, DD g, DD h)
.
 The following lines is problematic:
   
 int index;
    DD fv, fnv, gv, gnv, hv, hnv;
    if(topf < v){
        v = Min(topf, v);// v = top_var(F,G,H)
        index = topf;
        fv = nodes[ADDR(f)].Then;
        fnv= nodes[ADDR(f)].Else;
    }
    else{ fv = fnv = f;}

The if condition (topf < v) should be 
(topf <= v).

Therefore, please do some changes when using CacBDD.  

Thank you for finding a bug of CacBDD  

Best regards,
